## Introduction
Welcome to the SeedBot github, this has been an exciting project where we've learned a lot of robotics for the RLP 
subject in the CS degree from the UAB, we hope you can see we tried our best and you're welcome in helping to improve the Seedbot.
What are you going to find in the code?
A 2D simulation in pygame featuring A star and PPT path plannig in an occupancy grid map that has gotten its data from a ultrasonic sensor.

## Requirements
- Pygame
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
To launch the 2D Seedbot simulation you just need to get all the files and launch the game.py .
Interested in changing the starting and finish points? 
For the starting point go to game.py and change lines 46 and 47 although we reccomend to keep it like this.
For the final point
